        <h1>Beef Stew</h1>
        <h3>What you'll need: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef round steak, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped onion</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped carrots</li>
            <li>3 cups cubed Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh peas</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Let&apos;s make it:</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season beef with salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add flour and paprika and toss until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear beef in hot oil, stirring 
                occasionally, until well-browned, 10 to 11 minutes per batch. Transfer beef to a plate and leave 
                drippings in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add onion to drippings; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onion begins to caramelize, 
                about 10 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste; cook until it turns brown and begins to caramelize and stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour in red wine and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan 
                with a wooden spoon. Cook until wine is almost evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add thyme, rosemary, herbes de Provence, and bay leaves. Stir in broth and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Return beef to the pot, then remove from heat and cover with the lid.</li>
            <li>Braise stew in the preheated oven until beef is almost tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, potatoes, and more beef broth if needed. Cover the pot and return to the oven to braise 
                until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Discard bay leaves. Stir in peas, rosemary, and thyme. Serve hot.</li>

        </ol>
